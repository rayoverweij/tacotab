# :taco: TacoTab

A tabbing app for small World Schools-like debating tournaments. Currently in near-feature-complete beta.

## Overview

This app was originally built to cater to the needs of the Bard College Middle School-High School Debating Tournament, but is free to be used by anyone. It allows you to create a tournament with either one or two divisions (e.g. Novice and Open or Middle School and High School), which share a pool of judges. The app currently only supports tournaments of three rounds.

Teams consist of either two or three speakers. Whether there is a reply speaker or not and in what order the speakers speak does not matter for the app. Each room has one team in proposition and one in opposition. The app is extremely flexible - speakers can easily be added, swapped, or removed in between rounds, two-person teams can have an automatically calculated averaged third speaker added, and judges can be specified to only be available for certain rounds. For each round, the draw is automatically generated, but both teams and panels can be completely edited at will.

A general guidebook on how to tab a tournament, including more detailed instructions for this app, is coming soon!

## Getting started

Clone the repository to your local machine and run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

Start the development server with `npm start`. This app was created using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), so if you're not familiar with that, taking a look at its documentation will probably help you get a feel for this project faster.
